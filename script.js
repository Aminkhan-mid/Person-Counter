    count += 1

    // Now we are able to add and save but when we click save the countEl doesn't reset to 0 it stay where you saved the last number like for example if you clicked the ADD THEM button 7 times and the countEl is increased from 0 to 7 when you click save the number 7 is save in RECORDS but the countEl doesn't reset to 0, that is why we are setting countEl's textcontent to 0 when ever we click save
    countEl.textContent = 0
    // though countEl is set back to 0 when save button is clicked, still its value is still 7 or what every number you saved at, that is why we are setting count value to be 0 when ever we click save button
